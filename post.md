                      Infinity Health, a health-tech startup delivering secure task management solutions for healthcare professionals, today announced the launch of Infinity.

                    <p>
                      The app is designed to help clinicians, care workers and other health professionals manage their caseload and improve care in hospitals, care homes and the community.

                      Handover is known to be ‘one of the most perilous procedures in healthcare’, according to The Royal College of Surgeons, where patient safety incidents do occur, ‘poor communication at handover’ was identified as a major risk in 33% of incidents - NHS England 2015.
                    </p>                    
                    <p>
                      Currently, healthcare teams rely heavily on paper, pagers, fax and verbal communication during the multitude of shift changes and handovers. These channels of communication are inefficient and are often unsafe.

                    <p>
                      Healthcare teams using Infinity can easily access their caseloads and details of outstanding tasks for all their shared patients via mobile devices. Updates are sent in real-time making it easier to co-ordinate and complete tasks, releasing more time to care.
